            <p class="text-center">A passion project born in Austin, Texas, by two brothers with big dreams.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Payday Cards was founded by Dallen and Devyn Larson, two brothers from Austin, Texas, who share a deep love for Pokémon and technology. With a vision to simplify the lives of Pokémon card collectors, they started this journey to create a tool that combines passion with practicality.</p>
            <p>Though we’re still a small team with a growing user base, we’re committed to delivering a platform that collectors can trust and enjoy. Our dream is to turn Payday Cards into a community-driven hub for tracking, valuing, and celebrating Pokémon card collections.</p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> To grow alongside our users, improving Payday Cards based on your feedback and needs.</li>
            </ul>
